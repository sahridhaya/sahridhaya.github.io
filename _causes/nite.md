The concept of Sahridhayan Night is backed by our core belief of community sensitization and talent recognition. We realize the significant role that the powerful youth can play in transforming our society. With Indiaâ€™s growing young population, It is thereby important to foster the skills of the youth and converge its strength for the advancement of the community that we live in. Given our experience with the potential of an idea to influence a crowd, we intend to recreate the same for Sahridhayan Night. The motive behind this is also to gather sponsorships for our on-going projects.
