On the 5th year of **Gift A Smile**, we are preserving its true spirit of giving during the holiday season. The pilot project was organized at GR Public School, Trivandrum, Kerala on the 23rd of December 2015 with a dash of Christmas celebration behind the event. It witnessed over 100 school students from care homes in Trivandrum. With a special focus on school students, we look forward to organizing yet another successful event to fill the shelves with books and bags with stationeries.
