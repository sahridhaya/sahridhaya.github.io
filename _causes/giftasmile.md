For the last two years we had conducted projects with special focus towards the schools, students and orphanages with unmet needs, but are seldom looked into. The pilot project was organized at GR Public School, Trivandrum, Kerala on 23rd December, 2015 and had a dash of Christmas celebration behind the motive. The event witnessed over 100 school students from child care homes and orphanages in and around Trivandrum. The goodies were collected from public. The second phase was organized as a renovation effort of libraries followed by the Kerala flood of 2018, in two schools of the flood-hit Aranmula, a city in Pathanamthitta for a total budget of Rs. 1 lakh.
Currently, the team is working towards setting up a ‘school radio’ or a school’s own FM station at the Karikkakom Government School, Trivandrum.
