The Box is an initiative that recently opened under Sahridhaya and Recycle Bin (an architecture/urban design firm). We facilitate a multidisciplinary platform that liberates information and develops a proactive network of individuals. Bridging the gap between ideas and innovation, we democratize knowledge to foster authentic creativity. Our objective is to provide an open design model for people to use in situations regarding the adaptable use of spaces and unused plots in the city. We will combine people who wield different skill-sets and abilities through both theoretical and hands-on practical elements to provide an understanding of our spatial mapping process and land usage. Partnering with psychologists; we plan to explore how much our senses govern our relationship to our surroundings through specialised exercises and discussions.
