Quillpal is a platform to connect letter-writers and help them find pen-friends around the globe. Sahridhaya in association with QuillPal, we are attempting to take this exceptional experience to a larger audience, we are piloting a project in a government school in Seelampur, Delhi, among young girls across grades 7 and 8 from a Teach for India (TFI) classroom. Sahridhaya in association with Quillpal team will look out for schools where we could pilot this activity in Kerala. Thus, young girls will write letters from North to South and vice verse in the pilot stage starting from this academic year.
