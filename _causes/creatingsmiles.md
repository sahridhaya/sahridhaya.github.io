In order to unite people who wants to showcase talent and a set of people to appreciate this, we found various homes in Trivandrum as the perfect stage. Few of them are:

    Sree karunya mission (a specially challenged home in Neyyattinkara)
    Santhi mandiram (palliative care and rehabilitation centre for destitute and homeless in Vattapara)
    Christian missionary service children home (Neyyattinkara)
    Penile orphanage (Nellimoodu )
    Cheshire home (palliative care for mobility challenged in Kowdiar)
    Juvenile home (youth detention and care center of Govt of Kerala in Poojappura)
    Sevashram(old age home in Thiruvananthapuram)
    Sree guru raj mission(Specially challenged school in Neyyattinkara)
    Mahila mandiram(women care centre in Poojappura)
    Shishu vihar Vazhuthacaud(LP School)

We called this initiative as ‘Creating Smiles’.
